Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in lightweight, portable containers. Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc.), ensuring that the application runs consistently across different computing environments, whether it's on a developer's machine, a testing environment, or a production server.
